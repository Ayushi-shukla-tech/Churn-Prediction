# Churn-Prediction
Designing a churn prediction workflow involves creating a system to anticipate when customers might stop using our subscription service. This helps us pinpoint why they're considering leaving and gives us a chance to improve their experience. Initially, we gather a bunch of information about our customers, like how long they've been using our service, what they use it for, and any past interactions they've had with us.
The overall scope to build an ML-powered application to forecast customer attrition is generic to standardized ML project structure that includes the following steps:

Understanding the Goal:
First, we need to know that our aim is to predict when customers might leave our subscription service. This helps us figure out why they're leaving and improve our service.

Data Gathering:
We gather information about our customers, like how long they've been with us, what are the charges they are giving and what's their monthly bill is like.

Data Cleaning:
We clean up the gathered data, removing any mistakes or things that don't make sense. This makes sure our predictions are accurate.

Feature Creation:
We pick the important things from the data that could help us predict if someone might leave. These could be things like how often they use our service,  whether they are senior citizen or not or what are their total charges

Training a Model:
Next, we use the cleaned and processed data to train a machine learning model. This model learns from patterns in the data and tries to understand what factors are related to customers leaving or staying. It's like teaching a computer to recognize the signs that someone might be thinking of canceling their subscription. Since the feature was limited, So, the dataset was trained on various of model and the best model was used for optimization and performance enhancement.

Deployment and Monitoring:
Once our model is performing well, we put it to work. It starts analyzing new customer data to predict churn. We also keep an eye on it, regularly checking its predictions against real outcomes. If it's not performing as well as we want, we can adjust or update the model to make it better.

Continuous Improvement:
Churn prediction is an ongoing process. As we gather more data and learn from customer behaviors, we can refine our model and strategies. This helps us stay ahead of customer preferences and keep our churn rate low over time.
